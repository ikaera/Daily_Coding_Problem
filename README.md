# Daily Coding Problem

This project represents my personal commitment to improving problem-solving skills and preparing effectively for coding interviews by regularly working on programming challenges focused on data structures and algorithms. 
These challenges are carefully selected from real interview questions and other reputable sources and cover a broad range of important concepts such as logical thinking, pattern recognition, and writing efficient code. 
By practicing consistently and embracing a growth mindset, I aim to deepen my understanding of these topics and develop the ability to solve complex problems with confidence. 
This repository tracks my ongoing progress and reflects my dedication to continuous learning, growth, and maintaining a positive growth mindset over time.


## 📌 Goal

To develop expertise in coding interviews by consistently practicing and solving real-world technical problems — regularly solving one problem at a time — with clean, optimized, and well-documented code.

## 🛠️ Language

All solutions are implemented in **Python**.

## 🗂️ Structure

Each problem includes:
- The problem statement
- A clear and efficient solution
- Time and space complexity analysis (where applicable)
- Optional explanations or diagrams (when relevant)

## 🚀 Progress

Progress is tracked regularly. Contributions, improvements, or alternative solutions are welcome.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Backtracking  
- Recursion  
- Sorting & Searching  
- Bit Manipulation  
- And more...
